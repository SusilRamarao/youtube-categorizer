YOUTUBE CATEGORIZER
-------------------


A simple node application where you can store channel and video data in local by categories.

Youtube has playlists, but sometimes that is not enough. So create a node app where you can create categories and for each categories you can add your favourite channels and then for each channel you can save your favourite video.

--- Used Vue js for frontend development
--- simple node app to support open graph scrapper tool.

TODO:
 APP is in building state.
 In future planning to update if a channel uploads new video, user should be able to get notification and if interested add the video to respoective channel' video list.
